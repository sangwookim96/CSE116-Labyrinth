<Few Things to Note>
1. *********PULL often, COMMIT often.***********

2. *********Don't work on same class at same time.***********

3. Notify, if you want to work on your own.

4. JavaDoc format:  --> easy and fast to see definition of class and of method.
	/**       // "**"
	*
	*
	*/
	
	--> @param variable Write description of the variable in the parameter of method/class.
	--> @return returnValue If the code return something, write this notation please.
	
	JavaDoc matter. I heard JavaDoc is a part of grade.
	
5. Follow the Coding convention for easy reading.
	AND IT PREVENT MISCOMMUNICATION!!
